Run a full code review in this repo to find any bugs, unexpeted behaviors, or other problems. Do a true deep dive through all of the code. Be thorough and think carefully about what every line of code is meant to do and if it really does it well. For any problem you uncover, solve it and leave full documentation of it in a "review-report.md" file in the home of the directory. In addition to an itemized list of every issue you found and fixed, give your overall impression of the codebase in terms of how well written it is, what needs to be improved, and if it is in a good state to continue growing. 

Be completely honest with any issues that you find. It will really cost people time, energy, and effort if you hide problems for the sake of being "nice" or non-confrontational.
