In general, you should be sure to take your time and make sure everything is working properly before coming back to me and asking for more information.

Engage in strong test-driven developement. Write unit tests to make sure the code you write is working as intended. Use playwright, which you have access to, in order to run extensive tests on the app and make sure it is working how you think it should. 

Be sure to reference description.md, which has the details of the app you are making, as well as the design_notes.png image, which gives pictures of what you are building. 

Do not, for any reason, navigate out of the folder you are building the project in.
