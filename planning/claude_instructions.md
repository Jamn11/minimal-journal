In general, you should be sure to take your time and make sure everything is working properly before coming back to me and asking for more information.

Engage in strong test-driven developement. Write unit tests to make sure the code you write is working as intended. 

Be sure to reference description.md, which has the details of the app you are making, as well as the design_notes.png image, which gives pictures of what you are building. 

Do not, for any reason, navigate out of the folder you are building the project in. 

Before beginning any coding work, be sure to familiarize yourself with the codebase. You can find a description of the app in description.md, as well as design notes in design_notes.png. Also be sure to read the actual code to familiarize yourself. 

As you are working, be sure to maintain a file called memory.md. In this file, you should store anything you think is important to remember as you are working. Be sure to read it periodically to refresh youtself.
